# World Clock

This project is part of Lab 4 for the TECHIN 510 course. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate several key concepts:

- World Clock: Create a world clock application that displays the current time in different locations around the world. Users can select different time zones to view the corresponding time.
- Weather Condition with GitHub Action: Implement a GitHub Action that periodically fetches the weather conditions for a given location. The weather data is then displayed alongside the current time in the world clock application.
- PostgreSQL Server on Azure: Set up a PostgreSQL server on the Azure cloud platform. This includes provisioning a database instance and configuring it for use within the project.
